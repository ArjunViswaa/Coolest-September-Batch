        The dog <strong>(Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)</strong> is a domesticated
        descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated
        from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over
        14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, <del>prior to the development of
        agriculture</del>. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans.
        <i>Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans</i>, dogs have
        expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability
        to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
        canids.<sup>[4]</sup>

        The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
        sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<sup>[5]</sup> Dog breeds vary widely
        in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as
        hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the
        military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the
        millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the
        humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on
        human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
