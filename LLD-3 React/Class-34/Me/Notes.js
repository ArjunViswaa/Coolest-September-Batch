// React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
// Untill 2011, Facebook was using Vanilla javascript, jQuery and other libraries to build user interfaces. But it was getting difficult to manage the codebase.
// So in 2013, Facebook made it open source, and available for all developers around the world. Due to its popularity, it is now maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
// Companies that use React include Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, WhatsApp, Dropbox, Twitter, Spotify, Amazon and more.
// In 2011, Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, created a new library for building user interfaces.
// React is used to build single page applications.
// React allows us to create reusable UI components.
